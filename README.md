## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is a boilerplate for creating a web and mobile application using Next.js and Expo. It allows you to write code once and deploy it to both web and mobile platforms.

## üé• Demo <a name = "demo"></a>

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The app is built using Next.js for the web platform and Expo for the mobile platform. It shares a common codebase for both platforms, making it easier to maintain and develop.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To run the app, use the following commands:

For web:

```
npm run dev
```

For mobile:

```
expo start
```
